1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

    React Js is a javascript Library that builds large scale application effectively and rapidly. Most web application fetches api, uses animations etc and these might be too much weight for the dom, so react loads the webpage and subsiquently loads the DOM, thereby effectively managing so many events and maintaining speed.
